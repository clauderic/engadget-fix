# Engadget New Site Fix
This is a quick and dirty fix to get post excerpts and big thumbnails on the new (horrible) Engadget site.

### Instructions:

Go to http://engadget.com/all/ and copy pasete the code in index.js in your browser console (`Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + I` in Chrome) and press enter to apply the fix.

If there is enough interest, I might make this into a chrome extension. Feel free to contribute :)
